# Light @ Nanoworld

Welcome to my website! I am an Assistant Professor at IIT Ropar, specializing in the fascinating realm of light-matter interaction. My research primarily delves into two crucial domains: the exploration of light manipulation using nano/micro scale structures and the advancement of cutting-edge optical methods and technologies for investigating novel optical concepts.
Our research focus revolves around the modulation of light and its dynamic processes, employing various systems that incorporate emerging materials like high-index Topological insulators and phase-change materials. We leverage unique structures such as curved space metallic systems and metasurfaces, specifically designed to exploit the concept of light modulation within nano/micro systems. This research direction holds significant implications and applications, including wave guiding, deflection (prisms), focusing, steering, and more.
