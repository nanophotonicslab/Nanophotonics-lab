# Light @ Nanoworld

Welcome to my website! I am an Assistant Professor at IIT Ropar, specializing in the fascinating realm of light-matter interaction. My research primarily delves into two crucial domains: the exploration of light manipulation using nano/micro scale structures and the advancement of cutting-edge optical methods and technologies for investigating novel optical concepts.

Our research focus revolves around the modulation of light and its dynamic processes, employing various systems that incorporate emerging materials like high-index Topological insulators and phase-change materials. We leverage unique structures such as curved space metallic systems and metasurfaces, specifically designed to exploit the concept of light modulation within nano/micro systems. This research direction holds significant implications and applications, including wave guiding, deflection (prisms), focusing, steering, and more. Additionally, our ongoing projects aim to develop compact methods for beam-shaping processes using curved space optical plasmonic elements.

I earned my doctoral degree from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune in 2017. My doctoral research, conducted under the guidance of Prof. G V Pavan Kumar, focused on "Coupled Plasmonic Nanowires: Dual Channel Fourier Microscopy Studies." Furthermore, I completed my undergraduate and master's education from IISER Pune between 2007 and 2012.
